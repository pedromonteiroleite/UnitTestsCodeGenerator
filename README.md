# Unit Test Code Generator System

## Overview

UnitTestCodeGenerator is a C# backend tool designed to automate unit test creation. Leveraging Roslyn for parsing the syntax tree of UnitOfWork applications, it outputs unit test boilerplate for identified operations.

## Tech Stack

### Roslyn
Utilized for syntax and semantic analysis of C# code, enabling automated test code generation.

### XUnit
Implemented as the unit testing framework, providing a robust testing environment.

### AutoFixture
Automates the creation of test data, reducing manual setup in unit tests.

### Moq
Used for mocking objects in unit tests, facilitating the testing of interactions with external dependencies.

### MSBuild
Employed for project compilation and dependency management, ensuring build integrity.

### C#
Primary programming language for development, leveraging its advanced features for backend automation.

## Collaboration

Contributors with expertise in C#, .NET, and automated testing are invited to collaborate. The project offers a technical challenge in extending and refining the code generation capabilities.
